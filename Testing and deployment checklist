## 📋 Pre-Deployment Checklist

### 1. Smart Contract Testing

#### Unit Tests
```bash
# Install testing dependencies
npm install --save-dev @nomicfoundation/hardhat-chai-matchers chai

# Run all tests
npx hardhat test

# Run with gas report
npx hardhat test --gas-reporter

# Run with coverage
npx hardhat coverage
```

#### Test Cases yang Harus Lulus

**✅ FractionalAssetNFT Tests:**
- [ ] Create asset dengan semua parameter valid
- [ ] Fractionalize asset menjadi ERC20 tokens
- [ ] Hanya owner yang bisa fractionalize
- [ ] Tidak bisa fractionalize dua kali
- [ ] Verify asset owner functionality
- [ ] Token URI returns correct metadata
- [ ] Owner transfer works correctly

**✅ FractionToken Tests:**
- [ ] Buy fractions dengan payment yang benar
- [ ] Sell fractions dan terima payment
- [ ] Set fraction price (owner only)
- [ ] Distribute revenue correctly
- [ ] Claim revenue proporsional
- [ ] Prevent double claim
- [ ] Handle zero balance edge cases
- [ ] Approve and transfer works

**✅ FractionMarketplace Tests:**
- [ ] Create listing dengan approval
- [ ] Buy listing dengan payment benar
- [ ] Cancel listing (seller only)
- [ ] Platform fee calculation
- [ ] Withdraw fees (owner only)
- [ ] Set platform fee with limits
- [ ] Handle inactive listings

### 2. Security Audit

**🔐 Security Checks:**
- [ ] Reentrancy protection on all payable functions
- [ ] Access control properly implemented
- [ ] Integer overflow/underflow handled (Solidity 0.8+)
- [ ] No front-running vulnerabilities
- [ ] Safe math operations
- [ ] Proper event emissions
- [ ] No delegatecall vulnerabilities
- [ ] Input validation on all functions

**🛡️ Recommended Tools:**
```bash
# Install Slither (static analyzer)
pip3 install slither-analyzer

# Run Slither analysis
slither .

# Install Mythril (security analysis)
pip3 install mythril

# Run Mythril
myth analyze contracts/FractionalAssetNFT.sol
```

### 3. Gas Optimization

```bash
# Check gas costs
npx hardhat test --gas-reporter

# Optimize: Use these patterns
- Use uint256 instead of smaller uints (gas efficient)
- Pack storage variables
- Use memory instead of storage when possible
- Avoid loops when possible
- Use events for data storage when appropriate
```

**Target Gas Costs:**
- Create Asset: < 200,000 gas
- Fractionalize: < 3,000,000 gas (deploys new contract)
- Buy Fractions: < 100,000 gas
- Claim Revenue: < 80,000 gas
- Create Listing: < 150,000 gas

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### Phase 1: BSC Testnet Deployment

#### Step 1: Environment Setup
```bash
# 1. Get BNB Testnet tokens
# Visit: https://testnet.bnbchain.org/faucet-smart

# 2. Configure .env
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key
BSCSCAN_API_KEY=your_api_key
PINATA_API_KEY=your_pinata_key
PINATA_SECRET_KEY=your_pinata_secret

# 3. Verify network config
npx hardhat run scripts/verify-network.js --network bscTestnet
```

#### Step 2: Deploy Contracts
```bash
# Deploy to testnet
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network bscTestnet

# Save contract addresses
# Output example:
# FractionalAssetNFT: 0x123...
# FractionMarketplace: 0x456...

# Verify on BSCScan
npx hardhat verify --network bscTestnet 0x123... [constructor args]
```

#### Step 3: Initial Configuration
```javascript
// scripts/configure.js
const hre = require("hardhat");

async function main() {
  const assetNFTAddress = "0x123..."; // From deployment
  const marketplaceAddress = "0x456...";
  
  const [deployer] = await hre.ethers.getSigners();
  
  const AssetNFT = await hre.ethers.getContractAt(
    "FractionalAssetNFT", 
    assetNFTAddress
  );
  
  // Verify initial owner
  console.log("Contract owner:", await AssetNFT.owner());
  
  // Set up verified asset owners (for testing)
  const tx = await AssetNFT.verifyAssetOwner(deployer.address, true);
  await tx.wait();
  
  console.log("✅ Configuration complete");
}

main().catch(console.error);
```

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/configure.js --network bscTestnet
```

#### Step 4: Create Test Asset
```javascript
// scripts/create-test-asset.js
async function main() {
  // Upload test image to IPFS
  const imageURI = "ipfs://QmTest123...";
  const docURI = "ipfs://QmDoc456...";
  
  const AssetNFT = await hre.ethers.getContractAt(
    "FractionalAssetNFT",
    "0x123..."
  );
  
  const tx = await AssetNFT.createAsset(
    "Test Apartment Jakarta",
    "2BR apartment for testing",
    "Jakarta Selatan",
    "property",
    hre.ethers.parseEther("1"), // 1 BNB test value
    imageURI,
    docURI
  );
  
  const receipt = await tx.wait();
  console.log("✅ Test asset created!");
  console.log("Transaction:", receipt.hash);
}
```

#### Step 5: Frontend Integration
```javascript
// Update src/contracts/config.js with deployed addresses
export const CONTRACTS = {
  ASSET_NFT: "0x123...", // Your deployed address
  MARKETPLACE: "0x456..." // Your deployed address
};

export const NETWORK_CONFIG = {
  chainId: '0x61', // BSC Testnet
  // ... rest of config
};
```

#### Step 6: Test Complete Flow
```
User Flow Testing:
1. ✅ Connect wallet (MetaMask)
2. ✅ Switch to BSC Testnet
3. ✅ Create asset (verified owner)
4. ✅ Fractionalize asset
5. ✅ Set fraction price
6. ✅ Buy fractions
7. ✅ Distribute revenue (owner)
8. ✅ Claim revenue (investor)
9. ✅ Create marketplace listing
10. ✅ Buy from marketplace
11. ✅ View portfolio
```

## 🔍 Testing Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Happy Path
```
1. Owner creates asset (property worth 1000 BNB)
2. Owner fractionalizes into 10,000 fractions
3. Owner sets price: 0.1 BNB/fraction
4. Investor A buys 100 fractions (10 BNB)
5. Investor B buys 200 fractions (20 BNB)
6. Owner distributes 10 BNB revenue
7. Investor A claims: 10 * (100/10000) = 0.1 BNB ✅
8. Investor B claims: 10 * (200/10000) = 0.2 BNB ✅
```

### Scenario 2: Marketplace Trading
```
1. Investor A creates listing: 50 fractions @ 0.12 BNB/fraction
2. Marketplace approves transfer
3. Investor C buys listing (pays 6 BNB)
4. Platform fee deducted: 2.5% = 0.15 BNB
5. Investor A receives: 5.85 BNB ✅
6. Investor C now owns 50 fractions ✅
```

### Scenario 3: Edge Cases
```
Test these edge cases:
- [ ] Buy 0 fractions (should revert)
- [ ] Claim with 0 balance (should revert)
- [ ] Fractionalize twice (should revert)
- [ ] Buy with insufficient payment (should revert)
- [ ] Non-owner tries to fractionalize (should revert)
- [ ] Cancel others' listing (should revert)
- [ ] Revenue distribution with 0 holders
- [ ] Claim revenue twice
- [ ] Overflow fraction price (max uint256)
```

## 📊 Monitoring & Analytics

### Key Metrics to Track

**Smart Contract Metrics:**
- Total assets created
- Total fractions minted
- Total trading volume
- Platform fees collected
- Active listings
- Total revenue distributed
- Number of unique holders

**Performance Metrics:**
- Average gas cost per transaction
- Transaction success rate
- Time to confirmation
- Contract balance

### Monitoring Setup

```javascript
// scripts/monitor.js
const { ethers } = require("ethers");

const provider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(
  "https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/"
);

const contract = new ethers.Contract(
  contractAddress,
  contractABI,
  provider
);

// Listen to events
contract.on("AssetCreated", (tokenId, owner, name, value) => {
  console.log(`New asset: ${name} by ${owner}`);
  // Send to analytics / Discord / Telegram
});

contract.on("FractionsPurchased", (buyer, amount, cost) => {
  console.log(`Purchase: ${amount} fractions for ${cost}`);
});
```

### Alert System
```javascript
// Set up alerts for critical events
const ALERT_THRESHOLDS = {
  largeTransaction: ethers.parseEther("10"), // Alert if > 10 BNB
  failureRate: 0.05, // Alert if 5% tx fail
  gasSpike: 1.5 // Alert if gas 50% higher than normal
};

// Integrate with Discord/Telegram for notifications
```
